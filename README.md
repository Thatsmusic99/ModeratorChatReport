# ModeratorChatReport
Restricts player reporting to specific players, such as server moderators/admins.

Oh my God, another anti-chat report plugin! What makes this so unique compared to the, uh... million other ones out there?

The answer, in reality, is quite simple: instead of stripping signatures, stopping chat reporting for everyone, it restricts it to those in power, this being moderators and administrators. 

Other mods may outright disable the feature, but this keeps the reporting handy at one side for the worst case offenders such as hardcore racism and minor exploitation, like Mojang hopefully intended.

The main audience for this plugin is public servers that do not trust the reporting system on its own whilst it is still brand new.

## Downfalls
Does this solve the concerns with chat reporting altogether? *Absolutely not.* This plugin runs the risk for giving manipulative server owners and staff the control over their players. However, it stops normal users with mods like Gaslight from trying to forge fake reports, and restores some control to servers that are uneasy about the chat reporting feature.

If you are worried about joining problematic servers with this plugin enabled, there is an easy way to point it out:

The little grey indicator in chat is often used to say "This message is sent directly from the server". If it shows up like this, there's a good chance that a plugin like this is being used.

For the curious, this is what appears on the admin's game (Thatsmusic99):

It is also worth noting that having newly applied access to the reporting may hinder the validity of a chat report and get you into trouble with Mojang's moderators, especially since messages have a signature that depends on message order. However, it may be treated as if a player just joined the server and started receiving messages from the server.
